Erlich administers the Hacker Hostel, a tech incubator where Richard, Big Head, Dinesh, and Gilfoyle live and work in exchange for 10 percent of their potential businesses. Erlich clings to his glory days, when he sold aviation start-up Aviato, a move that, at least in his mind, qualifies him to be a svengali lording over other tech nerds. He still drives a car emblazoned with multiple Aviato logos and smokes copious amounts of weed.[1]

In Fiduciary Duties, a drunk Richard makes Erlich a Pied Piper board member, a decision he later regrets.

In Two Days of the Condor, it is revealed that Erlich no longer codes due to carpal tunnel syndrome.



<!--about

My name is Julia Silge and I am a data scientist at Stack Overflow. I love making beautiful charts, the statistical programming language R, Jane Austen, black coffee, and red wine.

I studied physics and astronomy, finishing my PhD in 2005. I worked in academia (teaching and doing research) and ed tech before moving into data science and discovering R. Now, my background in astronomy, physics, and education has given me a strong foundation for using data to answer interesting questions and communicate about technical topics with diverse audiences. I wrote a book with my collaborator Dave about text mining with R.

I live in Salt Lake City, UT, with my husband, three kids, and a handful of backyard chickens.

About Me

I am a Data Scientist at Stack Overflow. In May 2015 I received my PhD in Quantitative and Computational Biology from Princeton University, where I worked with Professor John Storey. My interests include statistics, data analysis, genomics, education, and programming in R.
Software

    broom: an R package for converting messy model outputs to a tidy format, for use with tools such as dplyr and tidyr.
    gganimate: an R package for creating animations within the grammar of graphics.
    subSeq: Subsample reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to determine if it has sufficient depth.
    stackr: R package for connecting to the Stack Exchange API.
    snippr: R package for managing, sharing, and installing RStudio code snippets.
    ParsePy: a Python API client for the Parse mobile backend.
    gleam: Python package for building interactive online visualizations without web programming.
    OASIS: Python package for annotating insertion sequences in prokaryotic genomes.
    BarNone: Python package to match barcodes in sequencing data to a catalog based on Levenshtein distance.
